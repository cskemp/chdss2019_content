# Day 2: Online experiments

### What we will cover

- Experiment logic and design for the "samplingframes" running example
- Branching, loops, functions
- Simple template expriment in jaysire 
- Putting it online
- More complex experiment functionality

### What we do not cover

- No time to go over all of the tutorials in jaysire, but they are linked below
- We will (hopefully) have time to walk through the code for the samplingframes project, but you will not create that yourself

### Useful resources

- jaysire: [tutorials](https://djnavarro.github.io/jaysire/), [reference](https://djnavarro.github.io/jaysire/reference/)
- jsPsych: [webpage](https://www.jspsych.org/)


### Notes

- The slides folder contains the (mostly)-final version of the slides
- The experiments folder contains subfolders for each of the sample experiments we'll be making during the course of the day. Solutions are in the slides and will be uploaded before the end of the week in a "solutions" subfolder
- The parser.R function in the experiments folder can be used for converting the data downloaded from the Google App Engine into a comma-delimited csv file.
- The code for the samplingframes experiment (written in jaysire) can be found in ../samplingframes/experiments/exp_samplesize
