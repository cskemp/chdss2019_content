```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We're going to continue our analysis is of th "Sydney beaches dataset, which contains info about the weather on a variety of Sydney beaches at different times.

```{r, dataload, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
data_file <- here("data", "sydneybeaches3.csv")
beaches <- read_csv(file = data_file)
```

The plot below plots the amount of bacteria found on the beaches by date.

```{r scatterplot, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = date,
    y = log10(enterococci)
  ) 
) + 
geom_point(size=2) +
theme_bw()
```

Add a blue line to this plot. Make sure the line goes *under* the points.

```{r lineplot, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = date,
    y = log10(enterococci)
  ) 
) + 
geom_line(colour="lightblue") +
geom_point(size=2) +
theme_bw()
```

Make a boxplot of the bacteria (on the y axis) by the name of the season (on the x axis). For extra credit, make sure the seasons are in chronological order.

```{r boxplot, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = reorder(season_name,season),
    y = log10(enterococci))
  ) + 
geom_boxplot() +
theme_bw()
```

Add jittered points to your boxplot, and colour them according to the name of the season. Make them slightly see-through for extra credit.

```{r jitteredplot, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = reorder(season_name,season),
    y = log10(enterococci))
  ) + 
geom_boxplot() +
geom_jitter(alpha=0.5) +
theme_bw()
```

Make a plot with four facets, one for each season, that shows a histogram of the temperature in each season.. 

```{r hists, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(x = temperature)) + 
facet_wrap(vars(reorder(season_name,season))) + 
labs(title = "Sydney temperatures",x = "Temperature", y = "") + 
geom_histogram() +
theme_bw() 
```

Change those histograms to density plots (hint: look up the geom called geom_density). For extra credit, colour them by season_name. (Hint: use the fill parameter)

```{r densities, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(x = temperature, fill=season_name),
) + 
facet_wrap(vars(reorder(season_name,season))) + 
labs(title = "Sydney temperatures",x = "Temperature", y = "") + 
geom_density() +
theme_bw() 
```
