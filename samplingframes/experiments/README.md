# Experiment Map

For multi experiment projects, it's important to keep track of what each of the
experiments was, when they took place, etc. This readme should explain all this.

There should be one folder per experiment, and they should be named according to
a standard scheme. Our running example is an experiment called "samplesize" and the corresponding folder is called `exp_samplesize', and has three subfolders, which should always be called `data`, `source` and `other`. If we had a different experiment called "baserates" there would be a separate folder `exp_baserates' for this experiment.
