# Analyses

This folder should contain the analyses. Each experiment should correspond to 
one (and only one, ideally) `.Rmd` file. Analysis files should be named in the
standard way. If there is an experiment called "urntask", for instance, the 
corresponding analysis script should be called `analysis_urntask.Rmd`.

The analysis file should read data files from the [data](./data) folder, but 
should never write anything to that folder.
