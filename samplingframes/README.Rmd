# Sampling Frames

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This project folder is for the sampling frames work (ie our running example at the  summer school). The goal is to show you how the files for a real research project might be organized.

This project is based on the newproject template at https://github.com/djnavarro/newproject.  It contains the following folders: [analysis](./analysis), [data](./data), [experiments](./experiments), [other](./other), [preprocessing](./preprocessing), [models](./models) and [writeup](./writeup).  

If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents, Google docs)
that are linked to the project, they should be listed in this document.
