# Project Organization, GitHub, Google App Engine

The morning of Day 1 covers Git, GitHub, and project organisation. The goal is to help you develop a workflow that saves time for yourself and allows others to easily understand and reproduce your work. The afternoon shows you how to host an experiment as a web application using Google App Engine.
