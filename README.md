Content for the 2019 Complex Human Data Summer School

There is a folder for each day of the school:

- day0: bootcamp
- day1: workflow, google app engine
- day2: online experiments
- day3: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis
- day4: statistical analyses and probabilistic models
- day5: experience sampling

The samplingframes folder is a project folder for the sampling frames work (ie our running example for the  summer school). The goal is to show you how the files for a real research project might be organized.
