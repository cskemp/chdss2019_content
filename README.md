Content for the 2019 Complex Human Data Summer School

There is a folder for each day of the school:

day0: bootcamp
day1: workflow, google app engine
day2: online experiments
day3: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis
day4: statistical analyses and probabilistic models
day5: experience sampling

The samplingframes folder is a project folder for the sampling frames work (ie our running example for the  summer school). The goal is to show you how the files for a real research project might be organized.
