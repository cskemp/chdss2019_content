# Statistics, Probabilistic Models

Day 4 focuses on running statistical analyses (both frequentist and Bayesian) in R, and Bayesian cognitive models. In addition to the materials in the `slides`,  `tutorials` and `exercises` folders, there are two notebooks relevant to the `samplingframes` project in the  `chdss2019_content/samplingframes` project folder.

`samplingframes/analysis/analysis_samplesize.Rmd` is an analysis notebook, and
`samplingframes/model/model_samplesize.Rmd` is a modelling notebook.
